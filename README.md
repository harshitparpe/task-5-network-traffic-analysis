# Task 5 - Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

Elevate Labs Internship Task

## Objective

This project involves capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark. The primary aim is to understand the usage and structure of key internet protocols during real-time activity.

## Steps Performed

- Installed and configured Wireshark on a Windows system.
- Selected the active wireless interface for capturing packets.
- Visited several websites, downloaded a sample file, and ran ping commands to generate traffic.
- Stopped the capture after around two minutes.
- Exported the full packet capture and created a filtered capture for HTTP traffic.

## Repository Contents

- `network_capture.pcap`: Raw packet capture of all observed traffic.
- `network_capture_http_filter.pcap`: Filtered view of HTTP traffic only.
- `report.txt`: Analytical summary of findings based on the captured data.
- `screenshot.png`: Raw Wireshark Capture display.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Key Concepts Explored

- Packet capture and live analysis
- Protocol differentiation and use cases
- TCP/IP communication behavior and diagnostics
- Filtering and exporting data in Wireshark
