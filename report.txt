Network Traffic Analysis Report â€“ Task 5

Objective:
To capture live network packets using Wireshark and analyze them to understand different internet communication protocols.

Analysis Summary:

1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Observed traffic over port 80 including GET requests and server responses.
- Provided insight into how browsers fetch resources from websites.
- Captured packet example: GET /index.html and corresponding 200 OK response.

2. DNS (Domain Name System)
- UDP traffic on port 53 used to resolve domain names like www.google.com to IP addresses.
- Response packets showed multiple IP addresses for redundancy.

3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Transport layer protocol used by HTTP and DNS.
- Captured full TCP handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- Observed sequence numbers, acknowledgment flags, and session teardown (FIN, ACK).

4. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- Used during ping commands to check connectivity.
- Echo Request and Echo Reply messages captured with varying TTL values.

Conclusions:
The exercise demonstrated the layered structure of network communications. Each protocol serves a distinct function in ensuring reliable data delivery, name resolution, and diagnostics. Wireshark's detailed view of each packet enabled granular inspection of real-world internet traffic in motion.
